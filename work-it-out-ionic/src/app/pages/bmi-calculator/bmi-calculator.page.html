<div class="info">
  <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It is commonly used to classify individuals into different weight categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.</p>
  <p>A BMI calculator helps you determine your BMI by inputting your weight and height. Once calculated, your BMI can give you an indication of your overall health status.</p>
  <p>Here's how BMI categories are typically interpreted:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Underweight: BMI less than 18.5</li>
    <li>Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9</li>
    <li>Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9</li>
    <li>Obesity: BMI 30 or greater</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It's important to note that while BMI is a useful screening tool, it may not be accurate for all individuals, particularly those with a high muscle mass. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized health advice.</p>
