### 1. INTRODUCTION. <a name="id1"></a>

The main purpose of this document is to provide a detailed guide for the planning, execution and follow-up of the "Work it Out" application development project. It contains relevant information for all parties involved in the project, from the development teams to the sponsors and end users. The document seeks to ensure a clear understanding of the project's objectives, scope, tasks, resources, risks and quality control policies, as well as to establish a framework for efficient project management. It also serves as a central reference for making decisions, solving problems and evaluating project progress throughout the project life cycle.

### 2. ORIGIN, CONTEXTUALIZATION AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT. <a name="id2"></a>

The idea for the "Work it Out" project originated from a recognition of the increasing interest in fitness and wellness among individuals worldwide. As modern lifestyles become more sedentary, there is a growing awareness of the importance of regular exercise and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, many people struggle to create and adhere to effective workout routines due to a lack of guidance, motivation, and resources. 

The "Work it Out" project aims to address these needs and challenges by providing a comprehensive web application that serves as a one-stop solution for individuals looking to improve their fitness and well-being. By offering features such as a workout diary, routine maker, exercise database, and user community, the project seeks to empower users with the knowledge, tools, and support they need to achieve their fitness goals effectively. Through this project, we aim to promote a culture of health and wellness, helping individuals lead happier, healthier lives.

### 3. GENERAL PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT. <a name="id3"></a>

The overarching goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive web application called "Work it Out" aimed at empowering individuals to improve their fitness and overall well-being. The primary purpose is to provide users with a user-friendly platform that offers a wide range of tools, resources, and support to help them effectively plan, track, and achieve their fitness goals.

### 4. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT (SCOPE). <a name="id4"></a>

Aquí describir el proyecto con cierto nivel de detalle, se puede tomar como referencia el anteproyecto. Indicar aquí cómo va a funcionar la aplicación en general, las partes en las que se va a dividir, qué arquitectura o estructura se va a emplear, tecnologías que se van a usar (por ejemplo, con qué se va a  validar los datos, cómo se hará el login, etc).
- Create a user-friendly web application accessible from various devices, including desktops, tablets and smartphones.
- Provide users with a workout diary where they can plan, track, and monitor their exercise routines and progress over time.

### 8. RISK CONTROL. <a name="id8"></a>

**Technical Risk: Compatibility Issues with Third-party APIs**
- Probability: Medium (0.50)
- Impact: High (0.80) → Disruption in development, potential rewriting of code, delay of more than 2 weeks in the project and an increase in cost.
- Type of Risk: High
- Action to be taken: Mitigation Plan → Regularly monitor compatibility with third-party APIs during development. Have backup options or alternative solutions ready to implement if compatibility issues arise.

**Resource Risk: Key Team Member Incapacity**
- Probability: Low (0.20)
- Impact: High (0.70) → Loss of critical knowledge and expertise, disruption in project timeline, delay of more than 2 weeks in the project and an increase in cost.
- Type of Risk: Medium
- Action to be taken: Contingency Plan → Develop and maintain comprehensive documentation of key tasks and processes. Cross-train team members to ensure redundancy in critical roles. Establish a transition plan for knowledge transfer in case of team member temporary incapacity. Regularly assess team morale and address any issues promptly to reduce the likelihood of incapacity.

**Operational Risk: Server Downtime**
- Probability: Medium (0.40)
- Impact: Medium (0.60) → Temporary loss of access to the application, disruption in service delivery, potential loss of users, delay of up to 1 week in the project, and a 10% increase in cost.
- Type of Risk: Medium
- Action to be taken: Contingency Plan → Implement redundant server architecture to minimize the risk of downtime. Regularly monitor server performance and implement proactive maintenance measures to prevent issues. Have a backup plan in place to quickly restore service in case of downtime. Communicate effectively with users about planned maintenance and downtime to minimize the impact on their experience.
- 
### 9. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND QUALITY CONTROL POLICY. <a name="id9"></a>

To ensure that our project stays on track and meets the set objectives, the following actions will be implemented:

- **Regular Progress Meetings:** Weekly progress meetings will be conducted to review the status of each task, identify any issues or challenges, and discuss potential solutions. New tasks will be reasigned each meeting.

- **Task Tracking and Reporting:** A centralized project management system will be utilized to track the progress of each task, including start and end dates, dependencies, and responsible team members. 

- **Quality Assurance Testing:** Comprehensive quality assurance testing will be conducted throughout the development process to identify and rectify any defects or issues in the application. This will include unit testing, integration testing, regression testing, and user acceptance testing. Test cases will be developed based on functional and non-functional requirements, and test results will be documented for analysis and improvement.

- **Performance Monitoring and Optimization:** Performance metrics will be monitored continuously to assess the application's performance and scalability.Performance optimization techniques will be implemented iteratively to enhance the application's efficiency and responsiveness.
